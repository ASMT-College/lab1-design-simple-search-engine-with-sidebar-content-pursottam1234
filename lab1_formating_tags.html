      <summary>What is formating tag?</summary>
      <p>
        Formating tag is a type of html element that is used to define the
        structure and presentation of content within a web document. These tags
        do not directly affect the content's meaning or semantics; rather, they
        are used to control how the content is displayed on the webpage.
        Formatting tags help define the visual appearance of text, images, and
        other elements on the page.
